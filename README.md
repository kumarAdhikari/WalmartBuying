# WalmartBuying
Provide URL for the Item and it will buy the item with the right condition met. It will go to Walmart and buy the item and if it is not available then it will continuously check 
for the item to be available.

## It worked in a very specific condition and was not tested in every scenario. 

The prerequisite is you have to have a saved credit card in file with Walmart and google chrome installed. 
##### This is not a final product AND I do not take any responsibility for any misuse of the product. It is for educational purposes only. #####

1. User will provide URL for item. 
2. User will provide Walmart Username and Password
3. App should open chrome and start the process of buying.

## I would love to see some feedback if it works. I am still new to programming and learning C#.
